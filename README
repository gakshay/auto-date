Auto Date v1.0.1 is a JS based auto-complete date selector which uses the Prototype Framework. Its an alternative to calender in browser which sounds annoying when one needs to enter future/past dates.

It validates the date before displaying the possible options. It make sure by prompting which date you are thinking in your mind. Say for example one types "01/05" it prompts 05 jan or 01 May. Sounds great!

It also understand certain literals as one usually writes in day to day communication e.g today, yesterday, tomorrow, coming weekend, new year, christmas, last month, saturday etc.

== Part 1 - Setup

Auto Date v1.0 uses the Prototype Framework. You will need to include these two Javascript files in your header.
  <script type="text/javascript" src="javascripts/prototype.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="javascripts/auto_date/auto_date.js"></script>

Include the Auto Date CSS file (or append your active stylesheet with the Auto Date styles).
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheets/auto_date/auto_date.css" type="text/css" media="screen" />
   

== Part 2 - Activate

You need to give a unique id to your html tag and assign your onclick event to "new AutoDate(this);". For example:
  <input id="input_date" name="input_date" onclick="new AutoDate(this);" type="text" value="June 30 2010">
  Rails:
  <%= text_field_tag "input_date", date, :onclick => "new AutoDate(this);"%>

  <a href="#" id="link_date" onclick="new AutoDate(this);; return false;">June 30 2010</a>
  Rails:
  <%= link_to_function date, "new AutoDate(this);", :id => "link_date" %>

where date is any date you want to display by default e.g. June 30 2010

== Feature 

ONLY_FUTURE_DATE to only display future dates when a user search for a date e.g. when a user book a flight it can only be for future date istead of some past date.
 
You can set "ONLY_FUTURE_DATE = true" by calling "new AutoDate(this, true)". It will ensure only future date is used.
If your application needs only future date set "ONLY_FUTURE_DATE = true;" in auto_date.js, by default its false.
